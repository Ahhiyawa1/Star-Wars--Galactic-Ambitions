 civic_high_republic_twilight_desc:0 "The twilight of the High Republic was marked by a golden age of peace and expansion. The Republic thrived under a powerful Senate and cooperative systems, yet shadows loomed in the distance. This era, while prosperous, was marred by growing corruption and unrest, a calm before the storm that would engulf the galaxy."

 civic_ruusaan_accords_desc:0 "Following the devastating New Sith Wars, the Ruusan Accords established a new era of peace by strictly limiting the expansion in galactic politics and military power. This agreement reinforced the Republic's reliance on peaceful diplomacy while forbidding Jedi from holding positions of political influence, a safeguard that would define the galaxy's power structure."

 START_SCREEN_GALACTIC_REPUBLIC:0 "The galaxy stands at a crossroads. Following the resolution of the Naboo Blockade by the Trade Federation, the Republic appears to have returned to peace, but beneath this calm lies growing instability. The Galactic Senate, once a bastion of diplomacy, is plagued by corruption and stagnation. Discontent festers in the Outer Rim, where corporate greed and systemic neglect have driven many worlds to the brink of rebellion. Chancellor Palpatine now leads the Republic, promising reform and unity. Yet whispers of shadowy conspiracies and militaristic separatist movements grow louder. The Jedi Order, guardians of peace for millennia, remain vigilant, but even they cannot sense the darkness rising in the galaxy's heart. Will you guide the Republic through this time of uncertainty, preserving peace and democracy? Or will the galaxy plunge into war, forever changing the fate of the Republic? The choices you make will determine the future of the stars"

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_GalacticRepublic_desc:0 "The Galactic Republic, once a shining beacon of unity and prosperity, now faces an uncertain future. For centuries, the Republic flourished under the ideals of the High Republic era, a golden age marked by expansion, diplomacy, and the guidance of the Jedi Order. Worlds across the galaxy prospered as trade flourished, knowledge spread, and peace seemed secure.  Yet as the galaxy grew larger, so too did the cracks within the Republics foundation. The Senate, once a chamber of cooperation, has become a stage for corporate influence and political stagnation. Wealthy trade conglomerates, most notably the Trade Federation, have used their economic power to strong-arm entire systems, exploiting loopholes in galactic law to expand their influence. The blockade of Naboo, a brazen act of aggression disguised as a legal dispute, has revealed the fragility of the Republics authority. Jedi Order, long the guardians of peace, now struggles to maintain stability. With conflicts simmering in the Outer Rim and corruption eroding trust in the Senate, the galaxy teeters on the brink of war. Many historians now speak of the High Republic era as a fading memory, a time of peace soon to be eclipsed by violence and division. In the shadows, powerful forces work to hasten the Republic's decline. Separatist movements gain momentum, disillusioned worlds speak of secession, and whispers of war grow louder. The ideals that once defined the Republic, diplomacy, cooperation, and justice, are now overshadowed by greed, fear, and political discord. The Clone Wars loom on the horizon, threatening to tear the galaxy apart. As the Republic struggles to hold itself together, one question remains, will this ancient institution endure, or will it crumble under the weight of its own corruption and complacency?"

 civic_seperatist_senate_desc:0 "In order to guarantee our succession from the Republic can be seen as legitimate, the Separatist Senate has been convened to reflect the opinions of the people. Unfortunately, the Republic would see our Senate as just a way to challenge the authority of Coruscant and must remain secret for the time being. The alternative is uncontrolled anarchy."
